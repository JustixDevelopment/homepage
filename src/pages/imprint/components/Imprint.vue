      <h2>Liability for contents</h2>
      <p>
        As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance
        with general legislation pursuant to Section 7 (1) of the German Telemedia Act (TMG).
        According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor
        transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate
        illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under the general
        laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in
        time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of any
        such infringements, we will remove the relevant content immediately.
      </p>
      <h2>Liability for links</h2>
      <p>
        Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no
        influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The
        respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the
        linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
        linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent
        control of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a
        violation of the law. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links
        immediately.
      </p>
      <h2>Copyright</h2>
      <p>
        The contents and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German
        copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution, or any form of commercialization of
        such material beyond the scope of the copyright law shall require the prior written consent
        of its respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted
        for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the
        operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content
        is identified as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement,
        please inform us accordingly. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such
        content immediately.
